# My Memory Game

A game where you have to match 2 squares per go. As you play the more moves you take the lower your score gets. This game has 16 squares with 8 pairs of colours. The some of the colours are very similar which adds a bit of difficulty. As the user matches the squares they are added to an array. When the array reaches 16 the game is compelted and a pop up comes up with the users score.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project just clone from my git at the link below
https://github.com/FizzyCustard/MemoryGame.git


### Prerequisites

This project uses just standard HTML, CSS and Javascript

## Deployment

I also did deploy it to netlify but I will not share that as I dont think there is a need just feel free to run this locally.

## Built With

* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) - Code editor for Personaliy I really like it
* [SublimeLinter](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/stable/) - used for spotting any issues with my code

## Authors

* **Fizzy Custard**


###Performance

One area that needs some work is on performance due to the images that are being used I am having to prefetch the images. What would be great is to change this so that the colours are added with CSS. For the second version I will probably look into this to improve speed of performance.
